    <h3>
      Cases Incorporated is a business all about Cases! We strive to provide our
      clients with protective cases for whatever they may need! If it is from
      protecting their phone, to protecting an entire house. No matter what it
      is, big or small we will have it... and if we don't we will make it. When
      our company first started in twenty twelve, protective cases were a thing
      for the elite. Our CEO Jonah Hill first created the business when he
      dropped and broke his first ever Academy Award. After he broke his award,
      he strived to never allow another person to break any object that they
      prized in their life. (we are still a work in progress company, we will
      not have all cases you may need.)
