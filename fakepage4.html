    <br>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Cases Incorporated is a business all about Cases! We strive to provide our clients
        with protective cases for whatever
        they may need! If it is from protecting their phone, to protecting an entire house. No matter what it is, big or
        small
        we will have it... and if we don't we will make it. When our company first started in twenty twelve, protective
        cases were a thing for the elite. Our CEO Jonah Hill first created the business when he dropped and broke his
        first ever Academy Award. After he broke his award, he strved to never allow another person to break any object
        that they prized in their life.
